M$ SQL Migration to Postgre SQL
===============================

These are my migration scripts for MSSQL to Postgres.

Some of my prior work is not versioned, but I hope this would 
be useful for people under the same task.

All connections are made from a Linux box, so drivers have to be
specified. I started using pymssql but it has some issues in
Unicode and Blob data managment.
